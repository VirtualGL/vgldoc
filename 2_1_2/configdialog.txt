* The VirtualGL Configuration Dialog
{anchor: Config_Dialog}

Several of VirtualGL's configuration parameters can be changed on the fly once
a 3D application has been started.  This is accomplished by using the VirtualGL
Configuration dialog, which can be popped up by holding down the ''CTRL'' and
''SHIFT'' keys and pressing the ''F9'' key while any one of the 3D
application's windows is active.  This displays the following dialog box:

You can use this dialog to adjust various image compression and display
parameters in VirtualGL.  Changes are reflected immediately in the application.

	Image Compression (Transport) :: This is a drop-down gadget with the
	following options:
	{nl}{nl} \
	__None (X11 Transport)__ : equivalent to setting ''VGL_COMPRESS=proxy''.
	This option can be activated at any time, regardless of which transport was
	active when VirtualGL started.
	{nl}{nl} \

	option is only available if the VGL Image Transport was active when VirtualGL
	started.
	{nl}{nl} \
	__RGB (VGL Transport)__ : equivalent to setting ''VGL_COMPRESS=rgb''.  This
	option is only available if the VGL Image Transport was active when VirtualGL
	started.
	{nl}{nl} \
	__DPCM (Sun Ray Transport)__ : equivalent to setting ''VGL_COMPRESS=sr''.
	This option is only available if the Sun Ray Image Transport was active when
	VirtualGL started.
	{nl}{nl} \
	__RGB (Sun Ray Transport)__ : equivalent to setting ''VGL_COMPRESS=srrgb''.
	This option is only available if the Sun Ray Image Transport was active when
	VirtualGL started.
	{nl}{nl} \
	__YUV (Sun Ray Transport)__ : equivalent to setting ''VGL_COMPRESS=sryuv''.
	This option is only available if the Sun Ray Image Transport was active when
	VirtualGL started.
	{nl}{nl} \
	See {ref prefix="Section ": VGL_COMPRESS} for more information about the
	''VGL_COMPRESS'' configuration option and its various parameters.

	Chrominance Subsampling :: This drop-down gadget is active only when using
	JPEG, Sun Ray DPCM, or Sun Ray YUV compression.  It has the following
	options:
	{nl}{nl} \
	__Grayscale__ : equivalent to setting ''VGL_SUBSAMP=gray''.  Available only
	with JPEG compression.
	{nl}{nl} \
	__1X__ : equivalent to setting ''VGL_SUBSAMP=1x''
	{nl}{nl} \
	__2X__ : equivalent to setting ''VGL_SUBSAMP=2x''
	{nl}{nl} \
	__4X__ : equivalent to setting ''VGL_SUBSAMP=4x''
	{nl}{nl} \
	__8X__ : equivalent to setting ''VGL_SUBSAMP=8x''.  Available only with Sun
	Ray DPCM or YUV compression.
	{nl}{nl} \
	__16X__ : equivalent to setting ''VGL_SUBSAMP=16x''.  Available only with
	Sun Ray DPCM or YUV compression.
	{nl}{nl} \
	See {ref prefix="Section ": VGL_SUBSAMP} for more information about the
	''VGL_SUBSAMP'' configuration option and its various parameters.

	JPEG Image Quality :: This slider gadget is active only when using JPEG
	compression.  It is the equivalent of setting ''VGL_QUAL''.  	See
	{ref prefix="Section ": VGL_QUAL} for more information about the
	''VGL_QUAL'' configuration option.

	Connection Profile :: This drop-down gadget is active only if the VGL Image
	Transport was active when VirtualGL started.  It has the following options:
	{nl}{nl} \
	__Low Qual (Low-Bandwidth Network)__ : Sets the image compression type to
	JPEG (VGL Transport), sets the Chrominance Subsampling to 4X, and sets the
	JPEG Image Quality to 30.
	{nl}{nl} \
	__Medium Qual__ : Sets the image compression type to JPEG	(VGL Transport),
	sets the Chrominance Subsampling to 2X, and sets the JPEG Image Quality to
	80.
	{nl}{nl} \
	__High Qual (High-Bandwidth Network)__ : Sets the image compression type to
	JPEG (VGL Transport), sets the Chrominance Subsampling to 1X, and sets the
	JPEG Image Quality to 95.

	Gamma Correction Factor :: This floating point input gadget is the equivalent
	of setting ''VGL_GAMMA''.  If using a gamma-corrected visual (SPARC clients
	only), then this gadget has no effect.  Otherwise, it enables VirtualGL's
	internal gamma correction system with the specified gamma correction factor.
	See {ref prefix="Section ": VGL_GAMMA} for more information about the
	''VGL_GAMMA'' configuration option.

	Frame Spoiling :: This toggle button is the equivalent of setting
	''VGL_SPOIL''.  See {ref prefix="Section ": Frame_Spoiling} and
	{ref prefix="Section ": VGL_SPOIL} for more information about the
	''VGL_SPOIL'' configuration option.

	Interframe Comparison :: This toggle button is the equivalent of setting
	''VGL_INTERFRAME''.  See {ref prefix="Section ": VGL_INTERFRAME} for more
	information about the ''VGL_INTERFRAME'' configuration option.

	Stereographic Rendering Method :: This drop-down gadget has the following
	options:
	{nl}{nl} \
	__Send Left Eye Only__ : equivalent to setting ''VGL_STEREO=left''.
	{nl}{nl} \
	__Send Right Eye Only__ : equivalent to setting ''VGL_STEREO=right''
	{nl}{nl} \
	__Quad-Buffered (if available)__ : equivalent to setting ''VGL_STEREO=quad''
	{nl}{nl} \
	__Anaglyphic (Red/Cyan)__ : equivalent to setting ''VGL_STEREO=rc''
	{nl}{nl} \
	See {ref prefix="Section ": VGL_STEREO} for more information about the
	''VGL_STEREO'' configuration option and its various parameters.

	Limit Frames/second :: This floating point input gadget is the equivalent
	of setting ''VGL_FPS''.  See {ref prefix="Section ": VGL_FPS} for more
	information about the ''VGL_FPS'' configuration option.

You can set the ''VGL_GUI'' environment variable to change the key sequence
used to pop up the VirtualGL Configuration dialog.  If the default of
''CTRL-SHIFT-F9'' is not suitable, then set ''VGL_GUI'' to any combination of
''ctrl'', ''shift'', ''alt'', and one of ''f1, f2,..., f12''
(these are not case sensitive.)  For example:

#Verb: <<---
export VGL_GUI=CTRL-F9
---

will cause the dialog box to pop up whenever ''CTRL-F9'' is pressed.

To disable the VirtualGL dialog altogether, set ''VGL_GUI'' to ''none''.

	!!! VirtualGL monitors the application's X event loop to determine whenever
	a particular key sequence has been pressed.  If an application is not
	monitoring key press events in its X event loop, then the VirtualGL
	Configuration dialog might not pop up at all.  There is unfortunately no
	workaround for this, but it should be a rare occurrence.
