* Using VirtualGL with Other X Proxies
{anchor: X11_Proxy_Usage}

The [[turbovncusage.txt#TurboVNC_Usage][previous chapter]] described how to use
VirtualGL with TurboVNC, but much of this information is also applicable to
other X proxies, such as RealVNC, NX, etc.  Generally, none of these other
solutions will provide anywhere near the performance of TurboVNC, but some of
them have capabilities that TurboVNC lacks (NX, for instance, can do seamless
windows.)

VirtualGL reads the value of the ''DISPLAY'' environment variable to
determine whether to enable the X11 Image Transport by default.  If ''DISPLAY''
begins with a colon ("'':''") or with "''unix:''", then VirtualGL will assume
that the X server connection is local and will enable the X11 Image Transport
as the default.  This should effectively make the X11 Image Transport the
default for most X proxies, but if for some reason that doesn't occur, then you
can force the use of the X11 Image Transport by setting the ''VGL_COMPRESS''
environment variable to ''proxy'' on the application server or passing an
argument of ''-c proxy'' to ''vglrun''.
