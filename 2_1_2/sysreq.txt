** Linux/Itanium

VirtualGL should build and run on Itanium Linux, but it has not been thoroughly
tested.  [[http://sourceforge.net/users/dcommander][Contact us]] if you
encounter any difficulties.  A pre-built TurboJPEG binary package is not
available for Linux/Itanium, so it will be necessary to build TurboJPEG from
source using the Intel Integrated Performance Primitives for Itanium
processors.

** Solaris/x86

	!!! * mediaLib 2.5 is included in Solaris 10 update 4 and newer.  If you
	are running an older version of Solaris, it is recommended that you download
	and install the mediaLib 2.5 upgrade from the link above.  mediaLib 2.5
	improves the performance of VirtualGL significantly on Solaris/x86 systems,
	when compared to mediaLib 2.4.
