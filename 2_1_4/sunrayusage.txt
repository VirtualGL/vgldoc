* Using VirtualGL in a Sun Ray Environment
{anchor: Sun_Ray_Usage}

As described in {ref prefix="Chapter ": Overview}, the Sun Ray environment
consists of both an X proxy and an ultra-thin hardware client.  If the
proprietary VirtualGL Sun Ray plugin is not used, then the Sun Ray server can
be treated just like any other X proxy and used with either the X11 Image
Transport or the VGL Image Transport, as described in
{ref prefix="Chapter ": X11_Proxy_Usage}.

If, however, the Sun Ray plugin is installed on the VirtualGL server, then a
slightly different procedure is required to connect to that server and use the
Sun Ray Image Transport.  This procedure assumes that VirtualGL is running on
a different machine than the Sun Ray server.

*** Procedure
#OPT: noList! plain!

	#. In the Sun Ray session, open a new terminal window.

	#. In the same terminal window, open a Secure Shell (SSh) session into
		the VirtualGL server:

		#Verb: <<---
		ssh -X {user}@{server}
		---

		Replace __''{user}''__ with your user account name on the VirtualGL server and
		__''{server}''__ with the hostname or IP address of that server.

	#. In the SSh session, start a 3D application using VirtualGL:

		#Verb: <<---
		/opt/VirtualGL/bin/vglrun [vglrun options] {application_executable_or_script} {arguments}
		---

	Consult {ref prefix="Chapter ": Advanced_Configuration} for more
	information on ''vglrun'' command line options.

Note that this procedure is substantially similar to the
[[#X11_Forwarding][X11 Forwarding]] procedure used with the
VGL Image Transport, except that it invokes ''ssh'' directly rather than using
the ''vglconnect'' wrapper script.  ''vglconnect'' launches ''vglclient'', and
''vglclient'' is not needed when using the Sun Ray Image Transport.

If the VirtualGL Sun Ray plugin is installed on a VirtualGL server, then
VirtualGL will try to use the Sun Ray Image Transport when displaying 3D
applications from that server to a Sun Ray client.  However, the Sun Ray Image
Transport requires that the Sun Ray client be on a network that is accessible
from the VirtualGL server.  Some Sun Ray deployments place the clients on a
private network that is visible only to the Sun Ray server, and the Sun Ray
Image Transport cannot be used in such cases (unless VirtualGL is running on
the Sun Ray server itself, but that defeats the purpose of the Sun Ray Image
Transport.)  If VirtualGL detects that it is running in a Sun Ray environment
but is unable to use the Sun Ray Image Transport, then it will fall back to
using the X11 Image Transport.
