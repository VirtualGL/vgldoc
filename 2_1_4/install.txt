* Obtaining and Installing VirtualGL

	!!! VirtualGL must be installed on any machine that will act as a VirtualGL
	server or as a client for the [[overview.txt#VGL_Image_Transport][VGL Image Transport]].
	It is not necessary to install VirtualGL on the client machine if using VNC
	or another type of X proxy.

** Installing VirtualGL on Solaris

	1. Download the VirtualGL Solaris package (''SUNWvgl-''__''{version}''__''.pkg.bz2''
		for SPARC or ''SUNWvgl-''__''{version}''__''-x86.pkg.bz2'' for x86) from the
		[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualgl/files/VirtualGL/][Files area]]
		of the [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualgl][VirtualGL SourceForge web-site]].

		issue the following commands:

		#Verb: <<---
		pkgrm SUNWvgl
		---

		(answer "Y" when prompted.)

		#Verb: <<---
		bzip2 -d SUNWvgl-{version}.pkg.bz2
		pkgadd -d SUNWvgl-{version}.pkg
		---

		Select the ''SUNWvgl'' package (usually option 1) from the menu.

 !!! VirtualGL for Solaris installs into ''/opt/SUNWvgl''.

** Installing VirtualGL on Mac (Client Only)

	#. Download the VirtualGL Mac disk image
		(''VirtualGL-''__''{version}''__''.dmg'') from the
		[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualgl/files/VirtualGL/][Files area]]
		of the [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualgl][VirtualGL SourceForge web-site]].

	#. Open the disk image, then open ''VirtualGL-''__''{version}''__''.pkg'' inside the
		disk image.  Follow the instructions to install the Mac client.  The Mac
		package installs files in the same locations as the Linux packages.

** Installing VirtualGL on Windows (Client Only)

	#. Download the VirtualGL Windows installer package
		(''VirtualGL-''__''{version}''__''.exe'') from the
		[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualgl/files/VirtualGL/][Files area]]
		of the [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualgl][VirtualGL SourceForge web-site]].

	#. Run the VirtualGL installer.  The installation of VirtualGL should be
		self-explanatory.  The only configuration option is the directory into
		which you want the files to be installed.

 !!! NOTE: The VirtualGL Windows installer does not remove any previous
 versions of VirtualGL that may be installed on your machine.  If you wish,
 you can remove these older versions manually by using the "Add or Remove
 Programs" applet in the Control Panel (or the "Programs and Features" applet
 if you are running Vista.)

** Installing VirtualGL from Source

If you are using a platform for which there is not a pre-built VirtualGL binary
package available, then log in as root, download the VirtualGL source tarball
(''VirtualGL-''__''{version}''__''.tar.gz'') from the 
[[http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualgl/files/VirtualGL/][Files area]]
of the [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualgl][VirtualGL SourceForge web-site]],
uncompress it, ''cd vgl'', and read the contents of ''BUILDING.txt'' for
further instructions on how to build and install VirtualGL from source.

** Obtaining and Installing the Sun Ray Plugin

The VirtualGL Sun Ray plugin is a proprietary add-on developed by Sun
Microsystems to integrate VirtualGL with the Sun Ray thin client environment.
This plugin was part of the Sun Shared Visualization product, which is now EOL.
However, the packages (''VirtualGL-SunRay.i386.rpm'' and
''VirtualGL-SunRay.x86_64.rpm'' for Linux systems, and ''SUNWvglsr'' for
Solaris systems) can be obtained from the Sun Shared Visualization 1.1.1
distribution, which, as of this writing, is still available for download from
the [[https://cds.sun.com/is-bin/INTERSHOP.enfinity/WFS/CDS-CDS_SMI-Site/en_US/-/USD/ViewProductDetail-Start?ProductRef=SharedViz-1.1.1-SP-F@CDS-CDS_SMI][Sun Download Center]].
