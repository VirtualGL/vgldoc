* Configuring a Windows Machine as a VGL Transport Client

** Configuring and Optimizing Exceed

If using the VirtualGL Client for Exceed, then add the Exceed path (example:
''C:\\Program Files\\Hummingbird\\Connectivity\\9.00\\Exceed'') to the system
''PATH'' environment if it isn't already there.

*** Disabling Pixel Format Conversion (Exceed 2006 and earlier)
#OPT: noList! plain!

	#. Load Exceed XConfig (right-click on the Exceed taskbar icon, then select
		__Tools-->Configuration__.)

	#. Open the "X Server Protocol" applet in XConfig.

		!!! If you are using the "Classic View" mode of XConfig, open the
		"Protocol" applet instead.

	#. In the "X Server Protocol" applet, select the "Protocol" tab and make sure
		that "Use 32 bits per pixel for true color" is not checked.

	#. Click "Validate and Apply Changes."  If XConfig asks whether you want to
		perform a server reset, click "Yes."

*** Disabling Backing Store
#OPT: noList! plain!

	#. Load Exceed XConfig (right-click on the Exceed taskbar icon, then select
		__Tools-->Configuration__.)

	#. Open the "Other Server Settings" applet in XConfig.

		!!! If you are using the "Classic View" mode of XConfig, open the
		"Performance" applet instead. 

	#. Select the "Performance" tab and make sure that "Default Backing Store" is
		set to "None."

	#. Click "Validate and Apply Changes."  If XConfig asks whether you want to

*** Enabling MIT-SHM
#OPT: noList! plain!

VirtualGL has the ability to take advantage of the MIT-SHM extension in
OpenText Exceed to accelerate image drawing on Windows.  This can significantly
improve the overall performance of the VirtualGL pipeline when running over a
local-area network.

The bad news is that this extension is not consistently implemented across
all versions of Exceed.  In particular, Exceed 8, Exceed 9, and Exceed 2008
require patches to make it work properly.  If you are using one of these
versions of Exceed, you will need to obtain the following patches from the
OpenText support site:

|| Product || Patches Required || How to Obtain ||
| Exceed 8.0 \
| ''hclshm.dll'' v9.0.0.1 (or higher){nl} \
	''xlib.dll'' v9.0.0.3 (or higher){nl} \
	''exceed.exe'' v8.0.0.28 (or higher) \
| Download all patches from the \
	[[http://support.hummingbird.com/customer/cspatches/patches.asp][OpenText support site]]. \
	{nl} \
	(__OpenText WebSupport account required__) \

| Exceed 9.0 \
| ''hclshm.dll'' v9.0.0.1 (or higher){nl} \
	''xlib.dll'' v9.0.0.3 (or higher){nl} \
	''exceed.exe'' v9.0.0.9 (or higher) \
| ''exceed.exe'' can be patched by running Hummingbird Update.{nl} \
	{nl} \
	All other patches must be downloaded from the \
	[[http://support.hummingbird.com/customer/cspatches/patches.asp][OpenText support site]]. \
	{nl} \
	(__OpenText WebSupport account required__) \
|
| Exceed 2008 \
| ''xlib.dll'' v13.0.1.235 (or higher){nl} \
	(or install the latest \
	[[http://support.hummingbird.com/customer/cspatches/patches.asp][Connectivity 2008 Service Pack]].) \
| Download all patches from the \
	[[http://support.hummingbird.com/customer/cspatches/patches.asp][OpenText support site]]. \
	{nl} \
	(__OpenText WebSupport account required__) \

No patches should be necessary for Exceed 10, 2006, or 2007.

Next, you need to enable the MIT-SHM extension in Exceed:

	#. Load Exceed XConfig (right-click on the Exceed taskbar icon, then select
		__Tools-->Configuration__.)

	#. Open the "X Server Protocol" applet in XConfig.

		!!! If you are using the "Classic View" mode of XConfig, open the
		"Protocol" applet instead.

	#. Select the "Extensions" tab and make sure that "MIT-SHM" is checked.
		{nl}{nl}
		{img: exceed2.png}

	#. Click "Validate and Apply Changes."  If XConfig asks whether you want to
		perform a server reset, click "Yes."

** Optimizing Cygwin/X

VirtualGL has the ability to take advantage of the MIT-SHM extension in
Cygwin/X to accelerate image drawing on Windows.  This can significantly
improve the overall performance of the VirtualGL pipeline when running over a
local-area network.

To enable MIT-SHM in Cygwin/X:

	#. Open a Cygwin Bash shell

	#. Run ''cygserver-config''

	#. Answer "yes" when asked "Do you want to install cygserver as service?"

	#. Run ''net start cygserver''

	#. Add ''server'' to the ''CYGWIN'' system environment variable (create this
		environment variable if it doesn't already exist)

	#. Start or re-start Cygwin/X

	#. Run ''xdpyinfo'' and verify that ''MIT-SHM'' appears in the list of 
		X extensions
