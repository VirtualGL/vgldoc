* ''vglrun'' and Solaris Shell Scripts

''vglrun'' can be used to launch either binary executables or shell scripts,
but there are a few things to keep in mind when using ''vglrun'' to launch a
shell script on Solaris.  When you ''vglrun'' a shell script, the VirtualGL
faker library will be preloaded into every executable that the script launches.
Normally this is innocuous, but if the script calls any executables that are
setuid root, then Solaris will refuse to load those executables because you are
attempting to preload a library (VirtualGL) that is not in a "secure path."
Solaris keeps a tight lid on what goes into ''/usr/lib'' and ''/lib'', and by
default, it will only allow libraries in those paths to be preloaded into an
executable that is setuid root.  Generally, 3rd party packages are verboden
from installing anything into ''/usr/lib'' or ''/lib''.  But you can use the
''crle'' utility to add other directories to the operating system's list of
secure paths.  In the case of VirtualGL, you would execute the following
commands (as root):

#Verb: <<---
crle -u -s /opt/SUNWvgl/lib
crle -64 -u -s /opt/SUNWvgl/lib/64
---

But please be aware of the security ramifications of this before you do it.
You are essentially telling Solaris that you trust the security and stability
of the VirtualGL code as much as you trust the security and stability of the
operating system.  And while we're flattered, we're not sure that we're
necessarily deserving of that accolade, so if you are in a security critical
environment, apply the appropriate level of paranoia here.

An easier, and perhaps more secure, approach is to simply edit the application
script and make it store the value of the ''LD_PRELOAD'' environment variables
until right before the actual executable is run.  For instance, take the
following application script (please):

Contents of ''application.sh'':
#Verb: <<---
#!/bin/sh
some_setuid_binary
some_application_binary
---

You would modify the script as follows:

Contents of ''application.sh'':
#Verb: <<---
#!/bin/sh
LD_PRELOAD_32_SAVE=$LD_PRELOAD_32
LD_PRELOAD_64_SAVE=$LD_PRELOAD_64
LD_PRELOAD_32=
LD_PRELOAD_64=
export LD_PRELOAD_32 LD_PRELOAD_64

some_setuid_binary

LD_PRELOAD_32=$LD_PRELOAD_32_SAVE
LD_PRELOAD_64=$LD_PRELOAD_64_SAVE
export LD_PRELOAD_32 LD_PRELOAD_64

some_application_binary
---

''vglrun'' on Solaris has two options that are relevant to launching scripts:

#Verb: <<---
vglrun -32 {script}
---

will preload VirtualGL only into 32-bit executables called by a script, whereas

#Verb: <<---
vglrun -64 {script}
---

will preload VirtualGL only into 64-bit executables.  So if, for instance,
the setuid binary that the script is calling is a 32-bit executable and the
application is a 64-bit executable, then you could use ''vglrun -64'' to
launch the application script.
