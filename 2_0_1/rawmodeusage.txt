* Using VirtualGL in Raw Mode with Other X Servers and Proxies

*** Other X Proxies
#OPT: noList! plain!

The [[turbovncusage.txt#TurboVNC_Usage][previous chapter]] described how to use
VirtualGL in Raw Mode with TurboVNC, but much of this information is also
applicable to other X proxies, such as RealVNC, NX, etc.  Generally, none of
these other solutions will provide anywhere near the performance of TurboVNC,
but some of them have capabilities that TurboVNC lacks (NX, for instance, can
do seamless windows.)

VirtualGL reads the value of the ''DISPLAY'' environment variable to
determine whether to enable Raw Mode by default.  If ''DISPLAY'' begins with
a colon ("'':''") or with "''unix:''", then VirtualGL will enable Raw Mode as
the default.  This should effectively make Raw Mode the default for most X
proxies, but if for some reason it doesn't, then you can force the use of Raw
Mode by setting ''VGL_COMPRESS'' to ''0'' or passing an argument of ''-c 0''
to ''vglrun''.

*** Raw Mode Over a Network

The [[turbovncusage.txt#TurboVNC_Usage][previous chapter]] described how to
use Raw Mode over a server network to send uncompressed pixels from a VirtualGL
server to a TurboVNC server.  But Raw Mode can also be used to send
uncompressed pixels to a client machine.  There are two main reasons why you
might want to do this:

	- Raw Mode may perform better than Direct Mode if the client or server CPU is
		extremely slow but the network is extremely fast (Gigabit or faster.)
	- Raw Mode uses about half the server CPU cycles to maintain the same frame
		rate as Direct Mode.  This can allow smaller servers to accommodate more
		users.

The procedure for using Raw Mode over a network is the same as the procedure for
using Direct Mode with a [[directmodeusage.txt#Direct_X11_Connection][Direct X11 Connection]]
-- with the following notable differences:

	#. It is not necessary to install or run the VirtualGL client.

	#. Once connected to the VirtualGL server via. SSh, it is necessary to either
		set the environment variable ''VGL_COMPRESS'' to ''0'' or pass an argument
		of ''-c 0'' to ''vglrun'' when launching VirtualGL.  Otherwise, VirtualGL
		will detect that the connection to the X server is remote, and it will
		automatically try to enable Direct Mode.  Setting ''VGL_COMPRESS'' to ''0''
		forces the use of Raw Mode, regardless of whether the X server is local or
		remote.

*** WORD OF CAUTION
#OPT: noList! plain!
Do not use SSh X11 tunneling with Raw Mode, as this will
reduce the performance by 80% or more.  It is necessary to use a direct X11
connection to sustain an interactive frame rate with Raw Mode on Gigabit
networks.
