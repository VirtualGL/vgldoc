* Obtaining and Installing TurboVNC

	!!! TurboVNC must be installed on any machine that will act as a TurboVNC
	server or client.  It is not necessary to install TurboVNC to use VirtualGL
	in [[overview.txt#Direct_Mode][Direct Mode]].  Also, TurboVNC need not
	necessarily be installed on the same server as VirtualGL.

		.tgz packages are provided for users of non-RPM-based Linux
		distributions.  You can use
		[[http://www.kitenet.net/programs/alien/][alien]] to convert these into
		.deb packages if you prefer.

	2. Log in as root, cd to the directory where you downloaded the RPM package,
		and issue the following command:
		#Verb <<---
		rpm -U turbojpeg*.rpm
		---

		of the [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualgl][VirtualGL SourceForge web-site]].

	#. Run the TurboVNC installer.  The installation of TurboVNC should be
		self-explanatory.  The only configuration option is the directory into
		which you want the files to be installed.

** Installing TurboVNC from Source

If you are using a non-RPM-based distribution of Linux or another platform for
which there is not a pre-built TurboVNC binary package available, then log in
as root, download the TurboVNC source tarball (''turbovnc-{version}.tar.gz'')
from the 
[[http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=117509][files area]]
of the [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualgl][VirtualGL SourceForge web-site]],
uncompress it, ''cd vnc/vnc_unixsrc'', and read the contents of ''BUILDING.txt'' for
further instructions on how to build and install TurboVNC from source.
