* Obtaining and Installing TurboVNC

	!!! TurboVNC must be installed on any machine that will act as a TurboVNC
	server or client.  It is not necessary to install TurboVNC to use the
	[[overview.txt#VGL_Image_Transport][VGL Image Transport]].  Also,
	TurboVNC need not necessarily be installed on the same server as VirtualGL.

		which you want the files to be installed.

** Installing TurboVNC from Source

package available, then log in as root, download the TurboVNC source tarball

[[http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=117509][Download area]]
of the [[http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualgl][VirtualGL SourceForge web-site]],
