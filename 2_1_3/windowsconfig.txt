* Configuring a Windows Machine as a Client for the VGL Image Transport

	#. Install Hummingbird Exceed if it isn't already installed.

	#. Add the Exceed path (example: ''C:\\Program Files\\Hummingbird\\Connectivity\\9.00\\Exceed'')
		to the system ''PATH'' environment if it isn't already there.

		that "Use 32 bits per pixel for true color" is not checked.

*** Enabling MIT-SHM
#OPT: noList! plain!

VirtualGL has the ability to take advantage of the MIT-SHM extension in
Hummingbird Exceed to accelerate image drawing on Windows.  This can improve
the overall performance of the VirtualGL pipeline by as much as 20% in some
cases.

The bad news is that this extension is not consistently implemented across
all versions of Exceed.  In particular, Exceed 8, Exceed 9, and Exceed 2008
require patches to make it work properly.  If you are using one of these
versions of Exceed, you will need to obtain the following patches from the
Hummingbird support site:

|| Product || Patches Required || How to Obtain ||
| Hummingbird Exceed 8.0 \
| ''hclshm.dll'' v9.0.0.1 (or higher){nl} \
	''xlib.dll'' v9.0.0.3 (or higher){nl} \

No patches should be necessary for Exceed 10, 2006, or 2007.

Next, you need to enable the MIT-SHM extension in Exceed:

	#. Load Exceed XConfig (right-click on the Exceed taskbar icon, then select
		__Tools-->Configuration__.)

	#. Open the "X Server Protocol" applet in XConfig.

		!!! If you are using the "Classic View" mode of XConfig, open the
		"Protocol" applet instead.

	#. Select the "Extensions" tab and make sure that "MIT-SHM" is checked.

	#. Click "Validate and Apply Changes."  If XConfig asks whether you want to
		perform a server reset, click "Yes."
